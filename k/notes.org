Elemntwise oprations are oprations done are elements of a matix or more, if an elementwise operation is done on 2 or matrices then their sizes should match.

- formal definition:

** Pinhole camera model
the pinhole model was created so that we don't have to deal with lenses in the early stage of developing an intuition for how image is formed.
